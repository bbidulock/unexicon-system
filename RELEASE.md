Maintenance Release 1.4
=======================

This is another release of the unexicon-system package that provides a
set of configuration files, dispatchers and hook scripts that are used
to mount the _Unexicon Live_ platform.

This release is a maintenance release that simply sets autoconf
directory defaults better and improves release packaging some more.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/unexicon-system/issues).
